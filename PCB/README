This folder contains subfolders for each different type of IV Swinger
PCB.  Each subfolder contains an EAGLE subfolder with the schematic and
board files created with the free version of EAGLE.  There is also a
Gerber subfolder with the manufacturing files.

IV_Swinger_2_module
-------------------
  This is an Arduino "shield" that replaces the PermaProto board in the
  original IV Swinger 2 design.  It plugs onto the top of the Arduino.
  An external electromechanical relay module is required, just like the
  original. The only external wiring is between a screw-terminal block
  on the PCB and the relay module and the binding posts.  Additional
  external wires are required for the optional temperature and
  irradiance sensors.

  Status: Verified (OSH Park, submitted IV_Swinger_2_module.brd).
          Gerber files should be ok, but have not been submitted to a
          fab.

  To order:
          OSH Park: https://oshpark.com/projects/cdoYwuqd/order
          PCBWay: submit Gerber files to www.pcbway.com


IV_Swinger_2_cell
-----------------
  This is similar to the IV_Swinger_2_module Arduino shield, but it is
  for use with PV cells.

  Status: ** TO BE ADDED **


IV_Swinger_2_ss_mod
-------------------
  This is similar to the IV_Swinger_2_module Arduino shield, but it uses
  three solid-state relays (SSRs) instead of the one electromechanical
  relay (EMR) module.  The only off-board connections are to the PV
  module itself (PV- and PV+). These can go to binding posts, or can be
  connected directly to wires with MC-4 connectors on their ends.

  Status: Order pending with PCBWay, but with known silkscreen problem.

  To order:
          OSH Park: submit IV_Swinger_2_ss_mod.brd
          PCBWay: submit Gerber files to www.pcbway.com


IV_Swinger_2_ss_cell
--------------------
  This is similar to the IV_Swinger_2_ss_mod Arduino shield, but it is
  for use with PV cells.  It requires four SSRs.

  Status: ** TO BE ADDED **

Advantages of EMR design:
  - EMR module is inexpensive (~$2), vs three SSRs (~$21)
  - "Clicks" tell you it's working
  - EMR module is easy to replace if it goes bad
  
Advantages of SSR design:
  - On-board:
     - No wires
     - No relay module to mount
  - Rated at 100V
  - No mechanical wearout
  - Silent
