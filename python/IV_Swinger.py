#
# This file contains the Python code that controls the IV Swinger
# hardware, captures measurements, and displays the results graphically.
#
# The hardware consists of a chain of loads that are selected or
# deselected using relays.  When a load is deselected, the current
# passes through a wire bypassing that load.  Ideally when all loads are
# deselected, the resistance of the chain would be zero (short circuit).
# In reality the bypass wires, relay terminal connections, and relay
# contacts have small resistances that add up to a non-negligible total
# (close to half an ohm).
#
# There are 16 relays (two 8-relay Sainsmart-type modules) which are
# driven by a MCP23017 I/O extender IC that is controlled from the
# Raspberry Pi i2c bus.  The MCP23017 outputs are connected to the
# relays as follows.  This list in is order from RIGHT to LEFT as seen
# from the front of the box.

#
# Note that one of the "loads" (OPEN) is actually not connected.  This
# was a design change required to support maximizing the lifetime of the
# relay contacts. The load bank does include a coil associated with this
# relay, but one of its leads is simply left unconnected so that when
# the relay is activated the circuit is open. The OPEN load is in the
# second position purely for logistical reasons; it was the easiest one
# to disconnect when the decision was made to implement the change.
#
# There is a double-pole single-throw (DPST) switch in the load circuit
# that has two purposes: 1) on one side it opens and closes the load
# circuit, and 2) on the other side it is connected to a GPIO pin so the
# code can sense whether the load circuit is open or closed and can poll
# for changes.  While the load circuit is open, the code continuously
# measures the voltage and records the last value before it detects that
# the switch was flipped - this is the Voc value.  Then it starts into a
# loop of incrementally adding to the load value and at each increment
# measuring and recording the current (I) and the voltage (V).
#
# The ADS1115 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is used for both the
# voltage and current measurements.  The ADS1115 is also controlled and
# read via the Raspberry Pi i2c bus.  Since the voltage generated by a
# PV panel can be much higher than the 5V maximum ADC input voltage, the
# actual voltage that is fed to the ADC input is divided down from the
# PV inputs using series resistors (classic voltage divider).  The
# software then scales that back up to calculate the original voltage.
# The current measurement is actually a voltage measurement too - across
# a low resistance (7.5 milliohm) "shunt resistor".  The current is
# calculated from Ohm's Law using the measured voltage and the known
# precision resistance of the shunt resistor.  This voltage is very
# small however (75mV for 10A) so it is amplified using a simple (and
# also classic) non-inverting op amp circuit before being fed to the ADC
# input.  The software does the math of converting the voltage value
# read by the ADC to a measured value for the current.
#
# Each of the measured I-V pairs is recorded for each selected load
# value.  Two important points are where V=0 and where I=0.  The current
# when V=0 is the short-circuit current, Isc.  The voltage when I=0 is
# the open-circuit voltage Voc.  Voc is captured when the DPST switch is
# in the open position.  Since there is still a small resistance when
# the circuit is closed - even with zero loads selected, the Isc value
# is estimated by a linear extrapolation from that "zero" load point and
# the next point (minimum load selected - "HALF").
#
# When the program is started the DPST switch is expected to be in the
# OFF (open) position.  If it is not, it prompts the user to turn it
# off, sounding a warning (piezo buzzer) until this has happened. When
# the switch is off, the program measures Voc. When Voc is stable it
# then asks the user to turn ON (close) the DPST switch, polling until
# this has happened.  During this polling the Voc value is continually
# updated since it could be changing.  When the switch is closed, the
# program begins the loop incrementing the load value and measuring the
# current and voltage at each point. The original code toggled the HALF
# relay at every increment to get ~1/2 ohm steps. But this results in a
# drastically shorter lifetime for this one relay. Now there are both
# "fine" and "coarse" modes.  The "coarse" mode starts with the HALF
# load, but only takes full steps after that. Even in "fine" mode, the
# HALF relay isn't switched at every step. Where the code determines
# that the curve is relatively straight (typically at the beginning and
# the end), it skips the half load values since they don't add value.
# This turns out to be a very good optimization - most of the time there
# are only two added points relative to coarse mode.  For this reason,
# the default is fine mode.  Coarse mode should probably be removed, but
# it has been left in.  The user can toggle the mode by pressing the
# pushbutton briefly (if the fine_mode_toggle property is set to True).
#
# The recorded values are written to a CSV file on both the Raspberry
# Pi's SD card file system and also on one or more USB thumb drives.
# The USB thumb drive(s) can then be removed and inserted in an external
# computer to import the CSV to Excel and/or to perform other analysis.
# Note that if more than one USB drive is found, the files are written
# to ALL of them.  This is to save time when the IV Swinger is used in a
# educational lab setting where there may be multiple lab partners.
# There are four USB ports, so up to four students can use their own USB
# thumb drives and no one has to copy the files from anyone else. The
# files are written to the /IV_Swinger directory on the SD card and all
# USB drives.  The subdirectory under /IV_Swinger is named for the date
# and time that the measurement was taken (yymmdd_hh_mm_ss)
# e.g. directory /IV_Swinger/141213_09_33_31 contains files for a
# measurement taken on December 13th, 2014 at 9:33:13 am.
#
# The program also uses pyplot (matplotlib) to generate a graph of the
# IV curve that it writes to a PDF file, which is also copied to the USB
# drive(s) in the same directory.
#
# If the DPST switch remains OFF (open) for more than 10 minutes, the
# program initiates a shutdown of the Raspberry Pi.  There is also a
# shutdown pushbutton switch that is monitored at all times; when it is
# pressed and held for more than 3 seconds the program does an immediate
# shutdown of the Raspberry Pi. Also if an unexpected exception is
# taken, the Raspberry Pi is shut down after a short delay.

       centripetal Catmull-Rom spline interpolation are supported. It
       also identifies the interpolated point with the highest power.

       The initial set of points is provided by the caller as a list of
       tuples, where each of the tuples contains the (I,V,R,P)
       values. The interpolation is based on the I and V values only.

       The results are available via the following properties:

          - The linear_interpolated_curve property returns a list of
            tuples containing the initial set of points and all of the
            linearly-interpolated points

          - The spline_interpolated_curve property returns a list of
            tuples containing the initial set of points and all of the
            spline-interpolated points

          - The linear_interpolated_mpp property returns the (I,V,R,P)
            tuple of the maximum power point on the
            linearly-interpolated curve

          - The spline_interpolated_mpp property returns the (I,V,R,P)
            tuple of the maximum power point on the spline-interpolated
            curve

       The num_interp_points property can be used to set/get the number
       of points that will be interpolated between each of the given
       points. Its default is 100.

    # The ADC differential inputs A0 and A1 measure the voltage across
    # resistor R2.  The Schottky diode clamps assure that the voltage seen
    # at the ADC inputs cannot be greater than +5V (plus Vfwd of diode) or
    # less than 0V (minus Vfwd of diode). This protects the ADC inputs. The
    # reason for resistor R3 is to limit the current in the event that the
    # PV is connected backwards.  Without R3, if PV- is > +5V, current would
    # flow through Schottky diode #3 into the +5V rail and there might not
    # be enough load to sink that much current, which could damage the
    # battery pack.
    #
    # The equation for a three-resistor voltage divider where the output is
    # measured across the middle (R2) resistor is:
    #
    #              R2                           R1+R2+R3

    # voltage. So we use the second equation.
