This directory contains the Python 2 source code for IV Swinger 1 and IV
Swinger 2. For now, this co-exists with the Python 3 code in the
parallel python3 directory, and both are being maintained.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anyone who is running the IV Swinger python code directly is highly
encouraged to use the Python 3 code.

Installing Python 2 and required packages
-----------------------------------------

 macOS with System Python:
 -------------------------
  
  Up to at least Big Sur (10.16), macOS includes Python 2.7.10 as the
  "system" Python. This is what you get if you just type "python" in a
  Terminal window without installing anything. In Catalina and Big Sure,
  it is deprecated and may not be included at all in later macOS
  releases. Tcl/Tk (which is used for the Tkinter GUI code) is also
  included, but is also an old version (8.5.9). To run the IV Swinger 2
  Python 2 code with the macOS system Python, you just need to install
  some Python packages using "pip" as follow:

      % pip install Pillow pyserial numpy matplotlib scipy Send2Trash

  If you don't have pip, see https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

  Note that Dark Mode is not supported with the pre-installed Python and
  Tcl/Tk.


 macOS with Python 2.7.18:
 -------------------------

  First, ask yourself, "why would I want to do this?" If you are going
  to go to the trouble of installing Python, you should install the
  latest Python 3 and run the Python 3 IV Swinger 2 code.

  There are multiple ways to install Python 2.7.18 (the last Python 2
  release). The easiest is to download and run the installer from
  python.org. But the best way (in my opinion) is to use the pyenv
  tool. This makes it easy to switch between different Python versions:

    - Install homebrew per instructions at https://brew.sh/

      % /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

         or update it, if it is already installed:

      % brew update

    - Install pyenv using homebrew

      % brew install pyenv

    - Set up your bash profile for pyenv:

      % echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.bash_profile

      For non-bash shells, see https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv

    - Install tcl-tk:

      % brew install tcl-tk

    - Install python 2.7.18 with config for tcl/tk and pyinstaller:

      % env PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-tcltk-includes='-I/usr/local/opt/tcl-tk/include' --with-tcltk-libs='-L/usr/local/opt/tcl-tk/lib -ltcl8.6 -ltk8.6' --enable-framework" pyenv install 2.7.18

    - Configure pyenv to use Python 2.7.18 in the IV_Swinger/python directory:

      % cd <your GitHub path>/IV_Swinger/python
      % pyenv local 2.7.18
      % python -V
      2.7.18

    - Install Python packages required by the IV Swinger 2 code:

      % cd <your GitHub path>/IV_Swinger/python
      % pip install Pillow pyserial numpy matplotlib scipy Send2Trash

    - Test:

      % cd <your GitHub path>/IV_Swinger/python
      % python IV_Swinger2_gui.py


 Windows with Python 2.7.18:
 ---------------------------

  First, ask yourself, "why would I want to do this?" If you are going
  to go to the trouble of installing Python, you should install the
  latest Python 3 and run the Python 3 IV Swinger 2 code.

  There are multiple ways to install Python 2.7.18 (the last Python 2
  release). The easiest is to download and run the installer from
  python.org. But the best way (in my opinion) is to use the Windows
  port of the pyenv tool. This makes it easy to switch between different
  Python versions:

    - Install and configure pyenv-win using instructions at:

        https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win#installation

    - Install python 2.7.18:

      > pyenv install 2.7.18

    - Configure pyenv to use Python 2.7.18 in the IV_Swinger/python directory:

      > cd <your GitHub path>\IV_Swinger\python
      > pyenv local 2.7.18
      > python -V
      2.7.18

    - Install Python packages required by the IV Swinger 3 code:

      > cd <your GitHub path>\IV_Swinger\python
      > pip install Pillow pyserial numpy matplotlib scipy Send2Trash

    - Test:

      > cd <your GitHub path>\IV_Swinger\python
      > python IV_Swinger2_gui.py
