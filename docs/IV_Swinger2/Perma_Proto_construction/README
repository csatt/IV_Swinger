The original IV Swinger 2 designs (for PV modules and PV cells) use a
"Perma-Proto" board and hand-cut, hand-stripped, hand-soldered hookup
wires for all of the connections between the resistors, capacitors, ICs,
and power/ground rails.  Hookup wire is also used for the connections
between the Perma-Proto and the Arduino.

Now there are printed circuit boards (PCBs) available that provide all
of these connections, making the construction much simpler, faster, and
more mistake-proof.  Furthermore, there are versions of the PCBs that
support on-board solid-state relays (SSRs) instead of the off-board
electromagnetic relays (EMRs).

It is recommended that, moving forward, all IV Swinger 2 constructions
use the PCB-based designs.

The Perma-Proto-based designs are still valid, and the software is
backward compatible.  This folder contains the legacy documentation for
construction of the Perma-Proto-based designs.
