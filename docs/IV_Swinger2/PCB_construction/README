The original IV Swinger 2 designs (for PV modules and PV cells) use a
"Perma-Proto" board and hand-cut, hand-stripped, hand-soldered hookup
wires for all of the connections between the resistors, capacitors, ICs,
and power/ground rails.  Hookup wire is also used for the connections
between the Perma-Proto and the Arduino.

Now there are printed circuit boards (PCBs) available that provide all
of these connections, making the construction much simpler, faster, and
more mistake-proof.  Furthermore, there are versions of the PCBs that
support on-board solid-state relays (SSRs) or field-effect transistors
(FETs) instead of the off-board electromagnetic relays (EMRs).

It is recommended that, moving forward, all IV Swinger 2 constructions
use the PCB-based designs.

The legacy documentation that describes the construction of older
Perma-Proto-based designs is contained in the Perma_Proto folder. This
folder contains the documents that are specific to construction using
the PCBs.

There are five PCB variants:

    EMR-based version for PV modules
    SSR-based version for PV modules 
    FET-based version for PV modules 
    EMR-based version for PV cells 
    SSR-based version for PV cells

The step-by-step instructions for building the PCB-based IV Swinger 2
variants are contained in the variant-specific documents:

The bills-of-materials (BOMs) for the PCB designs are NOT in this
folder; they are in the IV_Swinger/PCB/BOM folder.  Note that these BOMs
contain the parts that are soldered onto the PCBs, but they also contain
all of the other parts needed to completely construct a PCB-based IV
Swinger 2.  However, they do not include the parts or instructions for
adding temperature and irradiance sensors (see the IV_Swinger2_Sensors
document for that).
